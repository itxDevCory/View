            <p>While studying Psychology mostly at Kutztown University I was being groomed for leadsership at a growing high-end restaurant group in Pennsylvania. Working hard and committing to leading a team of 100 employees became physically daunting after
                10 years of missing was a daunting ten year task that resulted in nothing more than lost opportunities to with family or friends. Once a supportive environment soon fostered self-promotion and political poise to stave off tactical competition
                on teams instead fostered political tactics for job securityagressive self-promotion and tactical approaches to ex and advancement. constant worry and doubt of jo alternative successes were possible. e embracing the corporate climb. ito
                only this corporate climb wfostered nothing but pay increases with limited personal growth. After 15 years allegiant to hospitality management, 10 of which I served in an executive-level position for a growing upscale restaurant group.
                Working I took a leap of faith to explore South America to work with organizations that helped me grow into an advernturous, self-sustaining multi-lingual humanitarian with actual life tools to help myself and others. Naturually gravitating
                to all matters front of house and paradoxically those related to back-house technology, I began considering my natural tendancy to lean towards technology as a possible career-direction. It wasn't until my return home from a volunteer
                mission in Quito, Ecuador that I firmly made a commitment to break into the industry by any means availble. </p>
            <p>I am currently studying Web Development technology at Triology's bootcamp program held at University of Pennsylvania, graduation expected in May 2020. I am working hard to assimilate my self-taught ideas about coding with the formal coding
                instruction and theory of "best practices". The cirriculum is administered by industry elites that guide our main focus to technologies that are current, thriving and ubiquitous in most environments we may be hired into. The academic A-team
                has fostered growth, retention and motivation amoung my class.</P>
            <p></p>I continue to stay researched and in-tuned to the challenges that threaten global developement and sustainable methods of community developement and economic reform. After obtaining my professional certificate in full stack developement
            from UPenn I would like to build things that make a difference and pass along that knowledge to those skills to individuals with roadblocks to traditional education.</p>
